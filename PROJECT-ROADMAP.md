## 🎬 VIDEO PLAYBACK & PREVIEW ARCHITECTURE (Version 67)

### **🏗️ Core Architecture Overview**

The video playback system is built on a **modular hook-based architecture** that provides seamless transitions, dual-mode playback, and professional-grade user experience. Here's how all the pieces work together:

#### **1. Central Context Layer**
```typescript
// EditorContext.tsx - The Heart of Video Playback
interface EditorContextType {
  // Core References
  videoRef: React.RefObject<HTMLVideoElement>;     // Main video element
  audioRef: React.RefObject<HTMLAudioElement>;    // Master audio track
  
  // Control Functions
  togglePlay: () => void;           // Universal play/pause
  seekToTime: (time: number) => void;              // Relative seeking
  seekToAbsoluteTime: (absoluteTime: number) => void; // Timeline seeking
  jumpToStart: () => void;          // Jump to project beginning
  jumpToEnd: () => void;            // Jump to project end
  handleClipEnded: () => void;      // Clip transition trigger
  getAbsoluteTimePosition: () => number; // Current timeline position
}
```

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Provides video/audio element references to all components
- Centralizes all playback control functions
- Integrates specialized hooks for different concerns
- Maintains clean separation between UI and business logic

#### **2. Dual-Mode Playback System**

The system supports two primary playback modes via the `isAudioMaster` flag:

**🎵 Audio-Master Mode (DJ/VJ Workflow):**
- Audio track drives the timeline progression
- Video clips sync to audio position automatically
- Perfect for music video creation and DJ sets
- Handled by `useAudioTimeSync.ts`

**🎬 Video-Only Mode (Pure Video Editing):**
- Video clips drive timeline progression
- No audio dependency required
- Traditional video editor workflow
- Handled by `useVideoTimeSync.ts`

#### **3. Specialized Hook System**

Each hook handles a specific aspect of video playback:

**A. `useVideoSync.ts` - Basic Video State**
```typescript
// Synchronizes video element events with global state
- Listens to video 'play'/'pause' events
- Updates isPlaying state in Zustand store
- Foundation for all other video operations
```

**B. `useAudioTimeSync.ts` - Audio-Driven Timeline**
```typescript
// Audio-master mode timeline synchronization
- Monitors audio.currentTime via 'timeupdate' events
- Finds appropriate video clip based on audio position
- Automatically switches clips during playback
- Maintains seamless video playback while audio continues
- Critical for DJ/VJ workflow where audio is the master timeline
```

**C. `useVideoTimeSync.ts` - Video-Only Timeline**
```typescript
// Video-only mode timeline progression
- Monitors video.currentTime for clip boundaries
- Handles automatic clip transitions when video ends
- Calculates absolute timeline position from video clips
- No audio dependency - pure video editing workflow
```

**D. `usePlaybackControls.ts` - Universal Controls**
```typescript
// Centralized playback control logic
- togglePlay(): Handles both audio-master and video-only modes
- jumpToStart()/jumpToEnd(): Timeline navigation
- Maintains playback state consistency across modes
- Updates clip metadata when videos load
```

**E. `useSeekControls.ts` - Timeline Navigation**
```typescript
// Seeking and scrubbing functionality
- seekToAbsoluteTime(): Jump to specific timeline position
- seekToTime(): Relative seeking within current clip
- getAbsoluteTimePosition(): Current timeline position calculation
- Handles both audio and video synchronization during seeks
```

**F. `useClipTransition.ts` - Seamless Transitions**
```typescript
// Manages clip-to-clip transitions
- Handles video source changes during playback
- Maintains audio continuity during video transitions
- Calculates next clip timing and positioning
- Critical for uninterrupted playback experience
```

**G. `useAutoSelect.ts` - Intelligent Selection**
```typescript
// Automatic clip selection and timeline management
- Auto-selects first clip when timeline is populated
- Triggers resetToTimelineStart() when needed
- Maintains consistent selection state
```

#### **4. State Management Flow**

**Zustand Store (`store.ts`) - Central State:**
```typescript
interface EditorState {
  // Timeline State
  timelineClips: MediaClip[];              // All clips in timeline order
  selectedClip: MediaClip | null;          // Currently active clip
  currentTime: number;                     // Time within selected clip
  absoluteTimelinePosition: number;        // Position in overall timeline
  
  // Playback State
  isPlaying: boolean;                      // Global playback state
  isAudioMaster: boolean;                  // Playback mode flag
  
  // Audio State (when in audio-master mode)
  audioSrc: string | null;                 // Audio track source
  audioFile: File | null;                  // Original audio file
  waveform: number[];                      // Audio waveform data
  duration: number;                        // Total audio duration
}
```

#### **5. Component Integration**

**VideoPreview.tsx - The Visual Interface:**
```typescript
// Renders video player with professional controls
- Uses videoRef from EditorContext
- Displays current clip with proper aspect ratio
- Handles user interactions (click to play, progress bar)
- Shows timeline position and clip information
- Integrates keyboard shortcuts for professional workflow
```

**Timeline Components:**
```typescript
// Timeline.tsx + VideoTrack.tsx + AudioTrack.tsx
- Visual representation of timeline state
- Drag-and-drop clip management
- Audio waveform visualization
- Click-to-seek functionality
- Real-time playhead movement
```

#### **6. Critical Relationships & Data Flow**

**Initialization Flow:**
1. `EditorContext` creates video/audio refs and initializes hooks
2. `useAutoSelect` monitors timeline and selects first clip
3. Store updates trigger component re-renders
4. `VideoPreview` displays selected clip

**Playback Flow (Audio-Master Mode):**
1. User clicks play → `togglePlay()` starts audio + video
2. `useAudioTimeSync` monitors audio.currentTime
3. Hook calculates which video clip should be active
4. If different clip needed, hook triggers seamless transition
5. Video source changes while audio continues uninterrupted
6. Store updates with new selectedClip and timeline position

**Playback Flow (Video-Only Mode):**
1. User clicks play → `togglePlay()` starts video only
2. `useVideoTimeSync` monitors video.currentTime
3. When clip ends, hook finds next clip in timeline
4. Seamless transition to next video clip
5. Timeline position updates based on video progression

**Seeking Flow:**
1. User interacts with timeline → `seekToAbsoluteTime()`
2. Function finds appropriate clip for timeline position
3. Updates selectedClip and video.currentTime
4. If audio-master mode, also updates audio.currentTime
5. All components re-render with new state

### **🔧 Technical Implementation Details**

#### **Event Handling Strategy:**
```typescript
// Safe event listener management via safeEventListeners.ts
- Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Consistent event handler patterns across hooks
- Proper removal on component unmount
```

#### **Transition Timing:**
```typescript
// Critical timing windows for seamless playback
- 500ms timeout after transitions to prevent flickering
- Sub-50ms clip detection for smooth transitions
- requestAnimationFrame optimization for 60fps updates
```

#### **Error Recovery:**
```typescript
// Robust error handling throughout playback system
- Video loading failures gracefully handled
- Audio synchronization recovery mechanisms
- State consistency maintained during errors
```

#### **Performance Optimizations:**
```typescript
// Optimized for 60fps smooth playback
- Minimal re-renders through precise dependency arrays
- Efficient state updates using Zustand's selective subscriptions
- Smart video preloading to reduce transition delays
```

### **🚨 Critical Integration Points**

**When modifying video playback functionality, always consider:**

1. **Dual-Mode Compatibility**: Changes must work in both audio-master and video-only modes
2. **Hook Dependencies**: Each hook has specific responsibilities - don't cross boundaries
3. **State Consistency**: All state updates must maintain timeline/clip synchronization
4. **Transition Preservation**: Never break seamless playback during modifications
5. **Context Integration**: Always use EditorContext for video/audio element access
6. **Error Boundaries**: Maintain robust error handling during playback operations

### **🎯 Future Enhancement Guidelines**

**When adding new video features:**
- Create focused hooks for new functionality
- Integrate through EditorContext, not directly with components
- Maintain dual-mode playback compatibility
- Preserve seamless transition experience
- Follow existing state management patterns

**When refactoring video components:**
- Keep hooks modular and single-purpose
- Maintain existing public interfaces
- Test both playback modes thoroughly
- Preserve professional keyboard shortcuts
- Document any architectural changes
