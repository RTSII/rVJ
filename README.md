# rVJ: Immersive Audio-Visual Sync for DJ Sets

rVJ (a play on "Rob's Video Jockey") is a web app for creating beat-synced visual experiences from your DJ sets. Upload an audio mix, add video clips or generated effects, and sync them to the rhythm for an epic, immersive output. Perfect for VJs, content creators, or party vibes.
